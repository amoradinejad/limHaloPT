## LIM-PS-HM


## Description

This package can be used to compute integrated bispectrum of CO(J->J-1) and CII emission lines in redshift sapce. This code will be built upon the code developed by Azadeh Moradinezhad Dizgah for two previous publications 1801.10178, 1810.02850. At the moment, this folde only includes this previous version. The goal is to add the redshift-space computation of line power spectrum and integrated bispectrum using halo model and Fishe Matrix analysis for the two statistics individually and jointly.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
