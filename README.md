# LIM_PS_HM


## Description

This package can be used to compute integrated bispectrum of CO(J->J-1) and CII emission lines in redshift sapce. This code will be built upon the code developed by Azadeh Moradinezhad Dizgah for two previous publications 1801.10178, 1810.02850. At the moment, this folde only includes this previous version. The goal is to add the redshift-space computation of line power spectrum and integrated bispectrum using halo model and Fishe Matrix analysis for the two statistics individually and jointly.
