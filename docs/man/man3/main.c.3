Define which lines to compute, and how many points to have for z-interpolation
.PP
Note: The main line properties used in the calculation of the line power spectrum, which includes first and second moments of line luminosity (weighted by halo mass function) and luminosity-weighted linear and quadratic line biases are computed in function \fBLine_alloc_init()\fP\&. In that function, these quantities are calculate over an array of redshift values and then an interpolator for these quantities is initialized\&. The parameter 'ninterp' below, sets the number of interpolation points 
.br
 for this interpolator\&. If you set it too low, the redshift-dependance of line properties would not be accurate\&. In the tests done during code developement, ninterp = 150 give results at the precision needed\&. However large values of ninterp results in longer run time\&.
.PP
For testing installation and running of the code, you can set lower value of ninterp, to make the code run faster\&. But remember in your actuall runs, set ninterp to larger numbers\&.
.PP
If you do not need to compute the line properties for all the 7 lines below, you can set nlines to the number of lines you are interested, change the arrays of line[nlines] and JJ[nlines] to correspond to the lines you need to calculate\&.
.PP
Initialize the cosmology structure, which includes CLASS cosmology and \fBLine\fP structures

For testing the code, you can reduce the range of k, and z and also the number of points for each, nk, and nz\&.
