Documented cosmology module\&.

.PP
The first routine of this module initalizes the \fBCosmology\fP structure, which is the main building block of this entire code\&. This structure includes two sub-structures: the CLASS cosmology structure and line structure\&. Once the CLASS cosmology is initialized, various useful functions can be directly called from CLASS, example to compute matter power spectrum and transfer function, angular and comoving radii, growth factor and growth rate, variance of matter fluctuations and its derivative\&. Lastly, the module also includes various window functions and their derivatives\&.

In summary, the following functions can be called from other modules:
