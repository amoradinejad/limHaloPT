Welcom to lim\+Halo\+PT, a numerical package for computing the clustering and shot-\/noise contributions to the power spectrum of line intensity/temprature fluctuations within halo-\/model framework. The current version of the code, is limited to real-\/space, and redshift-\/space distortions will be included in the next release.

The extended halo model of line intensity power spectrum implemented in lim\+Halo\+PT, combines the predictions of EFTof\+LSS for halo power spectrum with the standard halo model to account for the nonlinear evolution of matter fluctuations and the nonlinear biasing relation between line intensity fluctuations and the underlying dark matter distribution in 2-\/halo term. Furthermore, the model includes the effect of large bulk velocities (Infrared Resummation) in the 2-\/halo term. The deviations from Poisson shot noise on large scales are also computed within the halo model.

This package is released together with the following publication, \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03717}{\texttt{ ar\+Xiv\+:2111.\+03717}}, where the prediction of the model are tested against new suite of simulated intensity (brightness temprature) maps of CO and \mbox{[}CII\mbox{]} lines. The mesheded fileds from Mithra\+LIMSims will be publically avilable on \href{http://cyril.astro.berkeley.edu/MithraLIMSims}{\texttt{ Mithra\+LIMSims}}. The code to analyse the simulated maps is an extension of the toolskit used in analysin Hidden-\/\+Valley simulations, and is publically avialble on \href{https://github.com/farnikn/MithraLIMSims}{\texttt{ LIM Analysis}}. As discussed in the manuscript above, the packages to compute the theory predictions and creating the simulated intensity maps can be straightforwardly extended to compute the power spectrum signal of other emission lines (emitted from star-\/froming galaxies), beside CO and \mbox{[}CII\mbox{]}.

The source code of this package is publically avaialbel on Git\+Hub at \href{https://github.com/amoradinejad/limHaloPT}{\texttt{ lim\+Halo\+PT}}. ~\newline

The lim\+Halo\+PT package calls various functions from \href{https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public}{\texttt{ CLASS}} Boltzman solver, including the matter power spectrum and transfer functions, growth factor etc. Therefore, you need to first download and compile CLASS code, create a \char`\"{} CLASS/lib/\char`\"{} folder and place the \char`\"{}libclass.\+a\char`\"{} in that folder. Furtehrmore, the loop calculations are performed with direct numerical integration, using routines of \href{http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/}{\texttt{ CUBA}} library. Lastly, the code heavily uses functions of \href{https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/}{\texttt{ GSL}} scientific library. Therfore, make sure that the two libraries are correctly linked to lim\+Halo\+PT by making necassary modifcations to the makefile (placed in Source directory) of lim\+Halo\+PT package.

Note that in order to compute the luminosities of spectral lines, a model of star formation rate as a function of halo mass and redshift, SFR(\+M\+\_\+h,z), should be assumed. Currently, the implemented model uses SFR(\+M\+\_\+h,z) from \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6105}{\texttt{ Behroozi et al. (2013)}}. The necassary input file, \char`\"{}sfr\+\_\+release.\+dat\char`\"{}, is included in \char`\"{}\+Input/release-\/sfh\+\_\+z0\+\_\+z8\+\_\+052913/sfr/\char`\"{} subdirectory. ~\newline
 ~\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Compilation}\label{index_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To compile, within the main directory of lim\+Halo\+PT, type\+: \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} ~\newline
 This would create an executable called \char`\"{}lim\+Halo\+PT\char`\"{} in the same directory, which you will use to run the code. If you modified the code, you need to first do \char`\"{}make clean\char`\"{} before doing \char`\"{}make\char`\"{}. When the code is compiled, a static library \char`\"{}liblim\+Halo\+PT.\+a\char`\"{} is created and placed in \char`\"{}lib\char`\"{} directory of lim\+Halo\+PT. If you would like to use any of the functions of lim\+Halo\+PT, you can link to this \char`\"{}.\+a\char`\"{} file as an external library.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The entire lim\+Halo\+PT package was developed, compiled, and tested on Mac OS X, using gcc version 7.\+5.\+0 compiler. ~\newline
 ~\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Basic usage}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To run the code, in the main directory of lim\+Halo\+PT, type \char`\"{}./lim\+Halo\+PT LCDM.\+ini\char`\"{} ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

Currently, the main output of lim\+Halo\+PT are the mean brightness temprature, linear and quadratic biases, clustering and shot noise contributions of 7 emission spectral lines, depending on the switch that you set in the ini file. The computation of these functions are performed within \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}} module. An example of the ini file is provided (LCDM.\+ini). If you want to call any of the functions of lim\+Halo\+PT, apart from those called by defacult, you neeed to add the function call to \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}}, recompile the code by first cleaning the previous build using \char`\"{}make clean\char`\"{} and building the package again with \char`\"{}make\char`\"{}.

Example\+: Lets say you want to compute the mean brightness temprature, linear and quadratic biases for one or multiple emission lines, as a function of wavenumber at several redshifts. In the .ini file, you should set the switch \char`\"{}switch\+\_\+\+Tbar\char`\"{} to be equal to \char`\"{}\+Tbar\char`\"{}, and the switches of shot and power spectra blank, i.\+e. \char`\"{}switch\+\_\+\+HMshot = \char`\"{} and \char`\"{}switch\+\_\+\+HMshot = \char`\"{}. The relavent functions that are called within \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}} are \mbox{\hyperlink{ps__line__hm_8c_ab3acf266df779fd7b847b2ca641efa01}{PS\+\_\+line\+\_\+\+HM()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{line__ingredients_8c_a3a13aa566fb639abeb29eae43e5fcfa8}{line\+\_\+bias()}}. For this function call, first two arrays for values of redshifts and wavenumbers for which the power spectrum is computed are created. the computed values for the three quantities is saved by default in an output file saved in \char`\"{}\+Output\char`\"{} directory. The number of emission lines to be included in the computation is set with \char`\"{}nlines\char`\"{} variable in the LCDM.\+ini file, while the name of the line is passed with line1, line2, ... variables. T The first argument of PS\+\_\+line\+\_\+\+HM, is the cosmology structure needed for performing any calculation in the code. See \mbox{\hyperlink{cosmology_8c}{cosmology.\+c}} module for more details. The LCDM.\+ini file contains description of parmaeters that should be set in the .ini file.

So here is how ythe \mbox{\hyperlink{ps__line__hm_8c_ab3acf266df779fd7b847b2ca641efa01}{PS\+\_\+line\+\_\+\+HM()}} function is called within \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c_a0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97}{main()}}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{int nz\_mean     = gb.mean\_nz;}
\DoxyCodeLine{double *z\_mean  = init\_1Darray(nz\_mean,0.0,gb.mean\_zmax);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{double lbias\_arr[2];}
\DoxyCodeLine{double b1   = 0.;}
\DoxyCodeLine{double b2   = 0.;}
\DoxyCodeLine{double Tbar = 0.;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{FILE *fp1;}
\DoxyCodeLine{char filename1[FILENAME\_MAX];}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{for(int i=0;i<nlines;i++)\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{      sprintf(filename1,"{}\%s/Tbar\_J\%d.txt"{}, gb.output\_dir, JJ[i]);}
\DoxyCodeLine{      fp1    = fopen(filename1, "{}ab"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{      fprintf(fp1,"{}\%s \%s \%s \%s \%s \(\backslash\)n"{},"{}\#"{}, "{}z"{}, "{}b1"{}, "{}b2"{}, "{}Tbar"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{      for(int j=0;j<nz\_mean;j++)\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{            Tbar = Tbar\_line(\&Cx\_ref, i, z\_mean[j]);}
\DoxyCodeLine{            line\_bias(Cx\_ref.Lines[i],z\_mean[j],lbias\_arr);}
\DoxyCodeLine{            b1   = lbias\_arr[0];}
\DoxyCodeLine{            b2   = lbias\_arr[1];}
\DoxyCodeLine{            fprintf(fp1,"{}\%12.6e \%12.6e \%12.6e \%12.6e \(\backslash\)n"{},z\_mean[j], b1, b2, Tbar); }
\DoxyCodeLine{      \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{      fclose(fp1);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{free(z\_mean);}

\end{DoxyCode}


By default, in addition to having the output in \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c_a0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97}{main()}} function for mean brightness temprature, biases, shot and clustering components of power spectrum, when computing the clustering and shot powers, individual loop contributions (in the former) and individual beyon-\/\+Possion contribution to the shot (in the latter), are also saved to output files which are stored in \char`\"{}\+Output\char`\"{} directory.

In addition to using lim\+Halo\+PT through \char`\"{}main.\+c\char`\"{} module which calls three specific functions, lim\+Halp\+PT can be exported as an external library to any other C code. For example if you would like to call the function that computes the halo mass function for a given theoretical model, once the liblim\+Halo\+PT.\+a library is linked to, the relevent function can be accessed from an external C code. ~\newline
 ~\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Testing}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
\char`\"{}\+Test\char`\"{} directory includes an automated test for the three main functions of lim\+Halo\+PT, which are called within \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\+c}} module. These tests are designed to test functionality of the code. Therefore, by default the parameters of the .ini file are set to values that allow to run the code fast. Note that these values should not be used when running the analysis, since the output would not have the precisioon needed for cosmological analysis.

Having compiled lim\+Halo\+PT package, and created the \char`\"{}liblim\+Halo\+PT.\+a\char`\"{} library, to run the test, switch to \char`\"{}\+Test\char`\"{} subdirectory. You have to first do \char`\"{}make\char`\"{}, and then you can run the code by typying \char`\"{}./test test\+\_\+\+LCDM.\+ini. Upon completion, the output files are stored in \char`\"{}Test/\+Output\char`\"{} directory.   \+Note that the test.\+c also can surve as an example of how you can link your code to liblim\+Halo\+PT.\+a library. $<$br$>$   @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md7 Attribution \+You can use this package freely, provided that in your publication you cite the following paper\+: Moradinezhad, Nikakhtar, Keating, Castorina\+: $<$a href=\char`\"{}\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03717}{\texttt{ https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/2111.\+03717}}\char`\"{} $>$ar\+Xiv\+:2111.\+03717$<$/a$>$.
