5/29/13:
Corrections to how error bars and medians were calculated for individual star formation histories.  (Previously, error bars were done as the densest 68% in linear space; now done as the densest 68% in log space).

4/8/13:
Corrections due to revised stellar mass loss formula (see updated version on the arXiv).

12/21/12: Updated based on latest SSFR and cosmic SFR constraints (collected over the period from 2006-2012).  Stellar masses at z>5 corrected for nebular emission lines.  Now includes star formation efficiencies.

10/17/12: Added relative stellar mass histories.

9/11/12: Initial public release.
